                Of course, you can learn how to build websites (and you can even use A.I. to make one in minutes), but information online

                <p class="book-description">Before I became interested in web development, I was an avid language learner.

                languages effectively.</p>

                <p class="book-description">This is where the philosophy of yin and yang originates. It's a historic text 
                that teaches philosophical principles through 88 short poems. The poems are 
                insightful and profound. For example, the phrase “A journey of a thousand miles 
                begins with a single step” comes from this book.</p>

                <p class="book-description">Thank you to Benjamin Riggs and his family for gifting me this book. It may seem 
                controversial to not rank it higher, but there's a good reason. Not everyone 
                follows the same religion, so placing it at the very top could undermine other 
                beliefs. Nevertheless, this book has laid the groundwork for many principles on how to live a good life.</p>

                how to animate effectively. Packed to the brim with information, yet easy to 
                understand thanks to its visually appealing content.</p>

                <p class="book-description">Ancient books have a special quality—they aren't written to sell something; 
                they're written to inform. And they perform that task exceptionally well. 
                This book needs no introduction, as it has profoundly shaped modern
