                Thank you to Benjamin Riggs and his family for gifting me this book. It may seem 
                controversial not to rank it higher, but there's a good reason. Not everyone 
                follows the same religion, so placing it at the very top could undermine other 
                beliefs. Nevertheless, this book has laid the groundwork for many principles for living a good life.

            <p class="book-description">
