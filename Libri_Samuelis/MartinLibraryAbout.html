                Hello to everyone reading this! If you can tell by this website, I am an avid learner, and I obtain most of my knowledge through books. 
                My purpose for creating this website was to apply my knowledge and share it with the world. I graduated from the University of North Texas 
                with a Bachelor's Degree in Environmental Science (May 2025). I am very scientifically oriented, and I love exploring new subjects such as 
                screenplay writing, web development, anatomy, and more.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="about-text">
                Outside of academics, I enjoy sports and am currently a Muay Thai fighter on my journey to becoming a world champion. 
                I also play the guitar, thanks to a birthday gift I received from a friend in 2024 (thank you, Magee!). 
                My goals are to become a Muay Thai world champion, achieve financial success, publish multiple scientific papers, and gain immense social 
                media recognition.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="about-text">
                I hope this website inspires you to learn new things. So go out there and <strong>LEARN!</strong>
